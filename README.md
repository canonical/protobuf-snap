# Protobuf Snap

[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/stub42/protobuf-snap.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/stub42/protobuf-snap)

This is snap packaging of the Protocol Buffers compiler,
from https://github.com/google/protobuf.

To simply install latest stable protoc:

    sudo snap install protobuf --classic

The snap installs aliases for protoc and protoc-gen-go so the
tools work as expected.

documentation on Protocol Buffers.
